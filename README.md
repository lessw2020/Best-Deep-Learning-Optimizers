# Best-Deep-Learning-Optimizers
Collection of the latest, greatest, deep learning optimizers (for Pytorch) - CNN, NLP suitable
</br>
12/27 - added DiffGrad, and unofficial version 1 support (coded from the paper). 
</br>
12/28 - added Diff_RGrad = diffGrad + Rectified Adam to start off....seems to work quite well.
